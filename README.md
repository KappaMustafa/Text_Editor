# Text Editor!
* I set up the plugins and the module rules.
* I also implemented asset caching.
* I added logic to the database.js for it to store and grab data
* Install button still doesnt work

# NOTE:
I deleted the wrong repo at one point and had to repush, thats why theres less commits than my original repo
